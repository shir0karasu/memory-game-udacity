## Instructions

Simple memory game with 8 pairs of cards. 

## How to play

- Click on the card that you want to open:
  + If the cards that you opened don't match, they will be closed after 1 second.
  + If the cards are matched, they will remain open and keep going :).
  
## Stars system

- One star will be removed after you committed 12 moves.
- The second star will be removed after you committed 16 moves.
- The last star will be removed after 20 moves.

(I know it's hard but try your best!)

## Timer 

Timer will start after the first card opened.

## Move counter

One pair of cards opened = 1 move.

### Good luck and have fun!!
